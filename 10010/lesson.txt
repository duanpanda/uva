1. Because in the search there are many char comparisons, it's best to make
the comparison as trivial as possible.  The best solution is to convert the

2. In order to avoid border checking, we usually extend the region and fill the
unused data (dummy data) in the extended region, thus the dummy data can be
used along with the real data in the uniform procedure.
